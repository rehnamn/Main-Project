#Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Based on Integrated Shallow CNN
+ The early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is critical for diabetics to lower the
blindness risks. Many studies represent that Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
based approaches are effective to enable automatic DR detection through classifying retinal
images of patients.
